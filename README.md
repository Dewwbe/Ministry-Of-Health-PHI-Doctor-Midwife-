 The system was designed to store and manage the following:
Student & School Sanitary Information 🏫🧼: Tracking hygiene and health conditions in schools.
Patient Management 🏥: Recording both infectious and non-infectious diseases.
Hotel Sanitary Facilities 🏨🧴: Monitoring hygiene standards in hotels for public health safety.
Awareness Sessions 📚: Organizing health awareness sessions led by the Public Health Inspector (PHI).
Midwife Management 🤰👶: Managing data for married couples, pregnant mothers, and newborn babies.
Vaccination & Student Management 💉📚: Tracking vaccination records and student health data under the supervision of doctors.
The system streamlined data management for healthcare professionals, ensuring better accessibility and decision-making. Using MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, the MERN stack provided a modern, scalable, and user-friendly interface.
